# PetFinderAlerts

Started working on this partly as a hobby project, but also because my girlfriend and I have been having a rough time finding a dog.
The built-in, "saved search" functionality on the main PetFinder site only allows for daily notifications, and it seems like the majority
of dogs that we see on the site are already gone before we can put in an application.

Initially this is being built as a console app, intending for quick-and-dirty usage by simply having the app set up in Windows task manager
to just run every few minutes and somehow send alerts (email? SMS? dialog window? ...TBD for now)

Could see this evolving into a phone app maybe? I feel that'd be the best platform for the functionality, but whether I end up going that
route is anyone's guess.
